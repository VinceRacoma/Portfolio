        <p>"I am a passionate second-year student at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Southwestern University Phinma</span>, 
            deeply interested in exploring the world of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Programming</span> and continuously 
            improving my skills in this field. Alongside my academic pursuits, I work as a part-time<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Virtual Assistant</span> to support myself financially while studying. 
            Although balancing my studies and work can be challenging at times, I remain committed 
            to managing both responsibilities effectively. I strive to maintain my focus, stay motivated, 
            and make the most out of every <span style="font-weight: bold;">learning opportunity</span> that comes my way."
